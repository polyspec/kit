## Unreleased

## 0.0.38

- kit is the npm package `@polyspec/kit`: a repository installs it with `make install-tools TOOLS=npm` and `make install-packages`, includes `scripts/kit/kit-bootstrap.mk`, and holds as copies only the files of `kit.copies`; `make kit-sync` writes them from the installed package and `make kit-check` ties them to the version of package-lock.json (K71-2).
- kit's tools and tests are TypeScript (`.mts`), checked by tsc 7.0.2 (K71-1); `make kit-test` fails when a run changes the checkout (K71-2-1).
- kit's tools use ecosystem libraries in place of rebuilds: ajv for schemas, picomatch for globs, smol-toml for TOML, pip-requirements-js for PEP 508, semver and @renovatebot/pep440 for versions; Composer versions come from composer's own `latest-status`; npm install-links copies are no longer read (K73, K100, K112–K116).
- Every kit tool is classified in `config/rebuild.json`, and the tools kit keeps carry a rebuild record in `docs/rebuild/` (K74).
- parity: feature units on runner test ids, fixed per-runner test conventions, files named like tests must be bound, spec anchors for profile reasons, a vitest runner, symbol extraction (Go, TypeScript, PHP, Python, Rust on a declared nightly), case directories and `.~` steps, Markdown lists and prose names (K75, K42, K43).
- Lint configuration for every ecosystem (phpcs PSR-12, phpstan disallowed calls, Composer policy, Rust workspace lints, golangci-lint with gomoddirectives, deadcode, ruff with TID251, vulture, oxlint with tsgolint, knip, API Extractor, `.editorconfig`); an advisory without a fixed release is accepted only by a recorded exception with its reason and removal condition (K77).
- check-toolchain checks the pins kit ships, floors equal to the pins, declared exceptions with scope, reason and retry, the TypeScript pin and `.npmrc` link keys, and names the signal that ended a tool (K78, K118).
- The editor boundary checker and the VS Code installer of the integration tests (K80).
- Markdown is read with mdast and micromark, owner-check reads make's database, pyproject pins are edited with toml-patch, wheel metadata comes from pip's report, govulncheck is read as SARIF, duplication is found by jscpd, and the unused TAP reader is removed (K120–K126).
- release coverage refuses a `file:` dependency that names no folder of the repository; only the npm release consumer project names the archives of its smoke (K129).
- Node 26.11.1.

### Consumer migration

Add:
- `@polyspec/kit` as a devDependency pinned to this release's asset URL with its integrity, in package.json and package-lock.json.
- `include scripts/kit/kit-bootstrap.mk` in the Makefile, in place of `include scripts/kit/kit.mk`.
- The copies that `make kit-sync` writes: `scripts/kit/kit-bootstrap.mk`, `scripts/kit/bootstrap/`, `workflows/release.yml`, `PRINCIPLES.md(.ko)`, `config/layout.kit.yml`, `ruff.toml`, `phpcs.xml.dist`, `phpstan.dist.neon`, `.golangci.yml`, `.oxlintrc.json`, `knip.json`, `config/api-extractor.kit.json`, `.editorconfig`.
- `config/checklist.json` for the repository's checklist, where missing; `rust-toolchain.toml` at the Rust pin, where the repository has Rust.

Change:
- `.node-version` 26.11.1 and `engines.node` `>=26.11.1`; Composer `require.php` `>=8.5` and `config.platform.php` `8.5`; `requires-python` `>=3.14`; go.mod `go 1.27.2` with no toolchain line; Cargo `rust-version` `1.99.0`; `typescript` `7.0.2`, with any other version declared as an exception.
- `config/parity.json`: `symbols` is `{ extractor, entry }`; narrow profiles and `nativeOnly` entries carry `spec` anchors; `config/toolchain.json` names `symbolExtractors` where Go or PHP symbols are extracted.

Delete:
- The vendored `scripts/kit/*`, `tests/kit/*`, `.kit/kit.lock.json` and every `kit.json` reference.
- The `.npmrc` keys `install-links` and `bin-links`; `replace` in go.mod (siblings use go.work); nested ruff configurations.

Proof: `make install-tools TOOLS=npm`, `make install-packages`, then `make kit-check toolchain-check layout-check documents-check owner-validate` pass; the checks that still fail are recorded in the repository's checklist.
