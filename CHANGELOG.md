## Unreleased

- kit is the npm package `@polyspec/kit`: a repository installs it with `make install-tools TOOLS=npm` and `make install-packages`, includes `scripts/kit/kit-bootstrap.mk`, and holds as copies only the files of `kit.copies`; `make kit-sync` writes them from the installed package and `make kit-check` ties them to the version of package-lock.json (K71-2).
