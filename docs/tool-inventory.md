# Tool inventory

[한국어](tool-inventory.ko.md)

The shared tools exist in several implementations. This inventory records where each one lives, its size, and the
implementation that kit takes as its base. A tool is merged into kit by taking the wider behavior of the implementations,
fixing it with a kit test, and replacing every copy with the vendored file. Measured on the working trees of the five
repositories (lines).

| Tool | template | crudui | hyper | ordered-json | orm | Base of kit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| release | `scripts/release.mjs` 388 | 357 | 317 | `scripts/release.py` 383 | `scripts/release/release.mjs` 302 | template, with the Go tag rule of ordered-json |
| push-gate | 125 | 149 | 121 | `push_gate.py` 192 | `scripts/check/push-gate.mjs` 121 | crudui |
| full-run | 199 | 240 | 246 | `full_run.py` 285 | `scripts/check/full-run.mjs` 328 | orm |
| git-hooks | 27 | none | 28 | none | none | hyper |
| holder-lock | 134 | 275 | 111 | none | none | crudui |
| check-documents | 151 | 95 | 70 | `docs_check.py` | none | template |
| owner-check | 219 | 254 | 178 | `owner_check.py` 171 | none | crudui |
| run-tests | 289 | 282 | 159 | `test.py` | none | template |
| target-report, ci-targets | 100, 52 | 73, 47 | none | `ci_run.py` | none | template |
| ci-passed | 36 | 39 | none | `ci_run.py` | `scripts/check/ci-passed.mjs` 32 | template |
| install-tools | 189 | none | none | `toolchains.py` | none | template |
| dependency state, review, gate | in kit since v0.0.2 | 317, 288, 185 | none | none | none | crudui, merged with kit |
| github-ruleset | 182 | none | 164 | none | none | removed (0.x has no ruleset) |

## Decisions

- Every tool is Node (`.mjs`). The Python tools of ordered-json are replaced and deleted.
- A repository differs from another only in `config/*.json`; a tool has no repository name or path in its code.
- `github-ruleset` is not vendored: the 0.x rule has no pull request and no ruleset, so the file and its Make targets are
  removed in template and hyper.
